This repository is for computer exercises in the course Digital Electronics 1 at Brno University of Technology (BUT). As a final project, our team did a "Morse Coder and Decoder" in VHDL language with further implementation for the NEXYS A7-50T FPGA board. You can find source files, test benches, and detailed descriptions here:
